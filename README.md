This project was done for Brackey's GameJam. I had help with the level developement and gametesting from a fellow WIT classmate. The code was written by myself in C#, however the conversion from C# to GD script was done with the assistance of LLMs. Clearview Mountain was made in Godot and the game can be played at https://jothua.itch.io/clearview-mountain

There are alot of bugs throughout the game that I don't intend to fix due to desire to work on other projects rather than polish up this one. If there are any graphical errors when running the game it is likely because the viewport is defaulted to 1920x1080.

Thank you, if you have an questions feel free to reach out to me on discord! @jothua.
